## Resources

### General

* when you click on a planet, its info panel shows a "resources" line item that shows what can be gathered from it
* most planets have fuel, shards, and their solar system's resources
* _x_ nodes per orbitable, resets every _y_ minutes
	* these numbers should be adjusted up and down to encourage people to spread out


### Questing

* something along the lines of "a star base in _system a_ needs _resource x_ from _system b_", they'll pay more than an average vendor


### Money

* "shards"
* shards can't be mined, you have to trade/vendor stuff to get them
* start with 50 shards?
* ideally, 1000 shards is a pretty good amount (the cost of a great upgrade)


### Away Missions

* random number of shards (5-10) per away mission
* each away mission lasts _n_ minutes (10?)
